# Cancer-Classification-model
OVERVIEW:

This repository contains a cancer classification model built using machine learning algorithms, specifically Logistic Regression and Neural Networks. The goal of this project is to accurately classify if a cancerous cell is Malignant or Benign cells based on input features derived from medical data.

FEATURES:

Dual Algorithm Approach: Implements both Logistic Regression and Neural Networks to compare performance and accuracy.

Data Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, normalization, and feature selection steps.

Model Training and Evaluation: Provides scripts for training the models and evaluating their performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualization: Contains scripts for visualizing the data distribution, model performance, and feature importance.
