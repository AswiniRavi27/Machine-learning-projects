## Description:  
  This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. By analyzing transaction patterns and behaviors, the system classifies transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate.  

## Techniques Used:  
  - **Logistic Regression**: A statistical method to model the probability of a transaction being fraudulent.  
  - **Decision Tree**: A tree-structured algorithm to classify transactions based on decision rules.  
  - **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning technique combining multiple decision trees for improved accuracy and robustness.  

## Key Features:  
  - Preprocessing of imbalanced data using techniques like oversampling or undersampling.  
  - Feature engineering for better classification accuracy.  
  - Evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
